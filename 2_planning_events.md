## Planning Events:

* Choose venue with gender neutral bathrooms, or make sure the venue will let you temporarily create them. Don’t just assume they will! Some won’t!
* Ensure correct information to book travel for speakers or issue honorariums. Not everyone has a government ID in the same name they use publicly
* Include topics regarding trans and non-binary people matter of factly — we are part of life
* Vet speakers for biased language and content — check with community members regarding prior engagements
* Have an inclusive Code of Conduct ([1](https://donutjs.club/conduct/), [2](https://www.recurse.com/code-of-conduct)) that you feel prepared to enforce
* Plan for pronouns stickers, buttons or tags for everyone as part of the registration process — not just for use by trans or non-binary folks
* Don’t ask minority speakers to only speak about minority issues — they have other skills too
* Ask community members what they need instead of assuming

### Key takeaways:
Be prepared, be proactive, be intentional. It won’t go unnoticed.
