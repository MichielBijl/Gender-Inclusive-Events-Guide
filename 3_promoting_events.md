## Promoting events

* Use diverse stock photos and images
* Explicitly state that you will have gender neutral bathrooms — this is a strong signal for gender minorities that you see them — and cis people don’t even notice this stuff!!)
* Publicize your event to diverse audiences through diverse channels, don’t expect people to come to you without knowing whether or not your event or org welcomes them
* Be ready to answer questions about your policy around inclusion
* Publish featured speaker’s pronoun choices on the schedule ahead of time so others can refer to them correctly without guessing

### Key takeaways:
Don’t make promises you can’t keep — imagine being promised wheelchair access and then having to struggle with stairs.

Damaged trust can be extremely difficult to repair.
